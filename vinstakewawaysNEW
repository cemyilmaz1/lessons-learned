In hiring engineers, it is very important to focus on "coachable" personality traits, specifically employees 
that have an "always-learning" mentality. This is an essential trait for three reasons: (1) it implies that they
do not think they are always right (2) they have a child-like enthusiasm for exploring and searching for understanding
and (3) they are ready for a rapidly changing industry.
