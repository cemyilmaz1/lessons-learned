Flexibility is a critical element to succeed when both developing and specifying software. 
Given the trend towards agile software development and an emphasis on working documents over 
final products, it is necessary that Programmers are willing to change and adjust accordingly 
as the project priorities shift and as everyone continues to learn from prior versions. Given 
the fact that initial assumptions will inevitably morph and change over the course of the project, 
one should seek programmers who understand the importance of flexibility.
