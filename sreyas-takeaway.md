Hiring Software Developers

It is important to think about the needs of the business and the amount of expertize required. The situations in which domestic developers would be more efficient than international developers. The pros and cons of using both â€“ having a 24 hour support cycle versus a team that can work closely with each other. Additionally, should the developer be hired full-time or on a contract basis and how much compensation you should give them.
