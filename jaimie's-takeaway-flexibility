Flexibility is a critical element to succeed when both developing and specifying software. Given the trend towards agile software
development and an emphasis on working documents over final products, it is necessary that Programmers are willing to change and 
adjust accordingly as the project priorities shift and as everyone continues to learn from prior versions. Given the fact that 
initial assumptions will inevitably morph and change over the course of the project, one should seek programmers who understand 
the importance of flexibility.
