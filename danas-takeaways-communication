Effective communication is key, both for managing the software development process itself and for creating and integrating effective teams.  
Assuring that all team members accurately understand expectations, assumptions and parameters of the project will be very important to make certain that labor is allocated effectively and that projects flow smoothly.  
This can also be helpful for controlling the scope of the project and maintaining focus. 
Creating a glossary can be very helpful so that all team members are using the correct terminology and are understanding it to have the same meaning.
